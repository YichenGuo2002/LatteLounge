## Introduction
LatteLounge is a web application where users can browse and post reviews about their favorite local coffee houses. It also provides personalized recommendations based on your preferences. To review or edit your previous posts, you must first log in to your account.

This project was developed using a range of full-stack technologies, including Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React.js, Python Scikit Learn, Axios, and Bootstrap. We used jw-pagination.js to create an easy-to-use pagination system, and the Yelp API to fetch nationwide coffee house data.
